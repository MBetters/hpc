** Instructions for Linux **

1.
	You must have cmake installed
	$ sudo apt install cmake

2.
	Now we must build the common and lmmin libraries
	$ cd common_build
	$ cmake ../common
	$ make install

	$ cd ../lmmin_build
	$ cmake ../lmmin
	$ make install

3.
	Lastly, we must build the ppm files
	$ cd .. # You should now be in the PPM_ONE directory
	$ cmake .
	$ make install

	To run ppm_one you just need to run the ppm_stable executable 		and give it a pdb file as input
	$ cd ppm
	$ ./ppm_stable -pdb <filename>.pdb

	Just running ./ppm_stable will display all of the available 		options
